In Littelmann's *Inventiones Mathematicae* paper *A Littlewood-Richardson rule for symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras*, the notion of a [Laskshmibai-Seshadri path]{.defn} or [LS path]{.defn} was defined. The basic idea is to generalise the notion of semistandard Young tableaux into any symmetrisable Kac-Moody type by replacing the tableau by a piecewise-linear path in the weight lattice, starting at 0 and ending at a weight. Suitable $e_i$ and $f_i$ operators can be defined on the set of paths, giving it the structure of a crystal.

A [path]{.defn} in this context is a piecewise-linear path $\pi \colon [0, 1] \to X_\bbR$ in the weight space, starting at the origin ($\pi(0) = 0$), with two paths being considered equal if one is a reparametrisation of the other. In other words, a path could be considered as an ordered list of its "corner" vertices, up to an equivalence where we are allowed to split and join segments appropriately. Littelmann defines root operators $e_\alpha, f_\alpha$ on this set of paths, which output either another path, or $0$ (meaning the root operator "kills" the path). Each root operator acts by cutting the path into three pieces $\pi = \pi_1 * \pi_2 * \pi_3$, where $*$ is a suitable concatenation of paths-starting-at-the-origin. The root operator either kills the path, or returns $\pi_1 * s_\alpha(\pi_2) * \pi_3$.

For a dominant weight $\lambda$, let $\pi_\lambda$ be the path connecting the origin to $\lambda$ in a straight line. One definition of the LS paths of shape $\lambda$ are as the set of paths generated by repeatedly acting on $\pi_\lambda$ by the $f_\alpha$. This special set of paths characterise the highest-weight representation $V(\lambda)$

Littelmann defines general root operators {$ e_\alpha, f_\alpha} for each simple root {$ \alpha}, which act on piecewise-linear paths in {$ X_\bbR} starting from the origin.

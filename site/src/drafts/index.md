This is a "laboratory" of work in various stages.

- [An explanation](/drafts/kl_basis/) of the inductive construction of the canonical basis.
- [Rexgraph](/drafts/rexgraph/): looking at the reduced expression graph for elements in small groups.
- [Bruhat order](/drafts/bruhat/): looking at the Bruhat order in groups, and quotients by parabolic subgroups.
- [Root poset](/drafts/root_poset/): shows the additive root poset, and the root graph made by reflections.
- [LS Paths](/drafts/lspaths/): displaying Lakshmibai-Seshadri paths.
- [Notes](/drafts/notes/): The digital equivalent of scribbles on a bit of paper.

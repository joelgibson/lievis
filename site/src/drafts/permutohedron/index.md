The permutohedron is a polytope associated to the symmetric group $S_4$ on four letters.

Let $\bbR^4$ be acted on by $S_4$ by permutations of coordinates, for example $(12) \cdot (-1, 3, 6, 5) = (3, -1, 6, 5)$.
A point $v \in \bbR^4$ is called *regular* if it is not fixed by any permutation, i.e. we have $\sigma \cdot v \neq v$ for all permutations $\sigma \in S_4$.
The vertex $v = (1, 2, 3, 4)$ is the prototypical example of a regular point.
The orbit $S_4 \cdot v$ of a regular point is a convex arrangements of points, and the associated polytope is called the *permutohedron*.

We will assume from this point onwards that we have fixed some choice of regular point $v$, and identify a permutation $w \in S_4$ with the point $w \cdot v \in \bbR^4$.
Each vertex $w$ is incident to three other vertices: $w s_1$, $w s_2$, and $w s_3$ for the *simple reflections* $s_i = (i, i+1)$.
Each vertex $w$ is also incident to three *faces*, where each face is labelled by a subset $I \subseteq \{1, 2, 3\}$ with $|I| = 2$.
Write $W_I = \innprod{s_i \mid i \in I} \subseteq W$ for the subgroup generated by the subset $I$ of simple reflections, then a face incident to $w$ is the left coset $w W_I$.

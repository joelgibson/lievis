- $C_n = \bbZ / n \bbZ$ the cyclic group of order $n$, generated by $\sigma$.
- $V = \bbR^n = \bbR\{e_i\}_{i \in \bbZ / n \bbZ}$ the permutation representation, $\sigma e_i = e_{i - 1}$.
- If $n = 2m$ is even, then $V$ decomposes into irreducibles, where in $V_k$ the rotation $\sigma$ is through an angle of $2 \pi k / n$ clockwise.
  $$ V = \underbrace{V_0}_{\text{trivial}} \oplus \underbrace{V_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus V_{m-1}}_{\text{2-dim}} \oplus \underbrace{V_m}_{\text{sign}}. $$
- If $n = 2m + 1$ is odd, then the sign representation is missing:
  $$ V = \underbrace{V_0}_{\text{trivial}} \oplus \underbrace{V_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus V_{m}}_{\text{2-dim}}. $$
- $V$ can be upgraded to a representation of the dihedral group $D_n$ on $2n$ elements, where a generating reflection $\tau$ satisfying $\tau \sigma \tau = \sigma^{-1}$ acts by $\tau e_i = e_{-i}$. On the two-dimensional representations, this looks like complex conjugation.
- See the notes for all the coordinates etc.

Put your cursor over a diagram, then the program will take that vector in $V_k$, include it into $V$, run ReLU, then project back down to all of the irreps.
The trivial and sign representations are included along the real axis (any imaginary component of the cursor is ignored).
The "normalise" checkbox attempts to scale the outputs so that the length of the image of $1$ is equal to $1$ in each irreducible.

The nonlinearities that can be selected are *Linear* $x \mapsto x$, *ReLU* $x \mapsto \max(0, x)$, or *Abs* $x \mapsto |x|$.
Any two of these form a basis over $\bbR$ for the space of PL maps $\bbR \to \bbR$, which is two-dimensional.
